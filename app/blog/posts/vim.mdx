# Next.js Project Setup Tutorial

In this tutorial, we’ll keep it simple and practical. Let’s get started quickly.

## Tools

- **Download Visual Studio Code** - Mac, Linux, Windows: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- **Node.js - Download**: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

Other tools may be helpful, but we’ll keep this tutorial focused on the essentials.

### Step 1: Create a Folder

Make sure to create a folder without any problematic characters — only letters and spaces should be used in the folder name.

### Step 2: Open the IDE

Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) in that folder.

### Step 3: Access the Terminal

Access the terminal from VSCode and type the following command, then press **Enter**:



This will start the setup for a new Next.js project.

## Step 4: Respond to Setup Prompts

During the setup process, you will be prompted with several questions. You can go with the default options for most of these. Here are the typical prompts and recommended responses:

```bash
1. **What is your project named?**  
   Enter the name for your project. For example, `my-app`.

2. **Would you like to use TypeScript?**  
   Type `Yes` or `No` depending on whether you want to use TypeScript.

3. **Would you like to use ESLint?**  
   Select `Yes` to enable ESLint, which helps maintain code quality.

4. **Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?**  
   Select `Yes` if you &#39; d like to use Tailwind for styling, or `No` if you prefer not to use it.

5. **Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory?**  
   Select `Yes` to keep your files organized within a `src` folder.

6. **Would you like to use the App Router (recommended)?**  
   Type `Yes` to use the latest routing method in Next.js.

7. **Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?**  
   Select `Yes` for faster development builds.

8. **Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)?**  
   Choose `No` unless you want to change the default import alias.
```
## Step 5: Navigate to the Project Folder

Once the setup is complete, navigate to your project folder by running the following command in the terminal (replace `my-app` with the name of your project):

## Step 6: Modify the Code

In the project folder, navigate to the file `app/page.tsx`. Open it and replace its contents as needed to fit your project. You can keep this basic setup for now.

## Step 7: Run the Development Server

To start the development server and view your project, run the following command in the terminal:

Once the server is running, open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should now see your Next.js app!

## Step 8: Test Your Project

After the page loads, interact with any components you've added to test how they function. The default template provides a basic structure, but you can customize and build on it to create your project.

By following these steps, you will have a basic Next.js project up and running on your local machine.
